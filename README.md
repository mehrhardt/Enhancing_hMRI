## Getting started

The code has been tested using Python 3.8 and a number of packages. The version numbers of the most important ones to generate our results are:
* [ODL](https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/) [1.0.0.dev0]
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [1.20.3]

To execute all code, run
* [run_all.py](run_all.py)
